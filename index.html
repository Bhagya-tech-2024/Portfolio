        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a third-year ICT student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences with a strong foundation in web development, including 
            <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>. I also bring experience in backend development using the 
            <strong>.NET framework</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>, as well as proficiency in cloud platforms like <strong>Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>. 
            Additionally, I have <strong>mobile application development skills</strong>, particularly in <strong>Android</strong>, and 
            <strong>project management experience</strong>, which have helped me efficiently coordinate and deliver projects. I am currently expanding my expertise by 
            following a <strong>data analysis module</strong> that covers <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>deep learning</strong>, and <strong>data processing</strong>. 
            My diverse skill set enables me to develop efficient, scalable, and innovative web and mobile solutions.

            <h3>Web Developer Role : Online Electronic Exercise Website</h3>
            <p>This is an ongoing project,part of my practical training at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, under
                the guidance of Jussi Ahonen, Senior Lecturer. The project involves developing an Online Electronic
                Exercise Website
                aimed at facilitating interactive and dynamic electronic exercises.In here I m using HTML,CSS,javascript
                and react to design the webpage.The Online Electronic Exercise Website is designed to provide a platform
                for users to engage in electronic exercises seamlessly. The exercises and their structure are based on
                templates and formats provided by Jussi Ahonen in Excel files. My contribution to this project involves
                translating these templates into a functional and user-friendly web design.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Website</h3>
            <p>This project is a responsive static website created as the final assignment for Web Visualization,
                hosted on GitLab Pages to showcase static content. The primary focus is on implementing a professional,
                visually appealing, and fully responsive design using a CSS library or framework, ensuring compatibility
                across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The website features a multi-page layout with consistent
                navigation and is styled using [insert CSS library/framework name] (e.g. Bootstrap) to
                enhance design and layout consistency. Git was used throughout the development process to manage version
                control, emphasizing the importance of responsive design and adherence to course requirements.</p>

            <h3>Smart Car Project with Raspberry Pi</h3>
            <p>My group partner and I worked together to create a smart car powered by a Raspberry Pi. We combined
                hardware and software to enable features like remote control, sensor based navigation, and real-time
                data processing. This project gave me hands-on experience with IoT and embedded systems while also
                strengthening my teamwork and problem solving skills. It was an exciting opportunity to explore how
                Raspberry Pi can be used in automation and robotics.</p>

            <h3>Visualization of the Mountain Car Problem</h3>
            <p>The visualization of the Mountain Car problem demonstrates how a car, starting at the bottom of a valley,
                learns to reach a goal at the top of a hill. Since the car's engine isn't powerful enough to climb the
                hill directly, it must swing back and forth to build enough momentum to reach the flag at the top.
                Through reinforcement learning, the car gradually learns to time its movements, use gravity to its
                advantage, and make the most of its swings. As the episodes progress, the car becomes more efficient,
                with earlier swings helping it gather momentum for the final push. Some episodes take fewer swings,
                while others may require more time and different strategies to succeed. The goal is reached when the car
                reaches position 0.5, and the faster it does so, the more efficient the solution. This process
                highlights how the car learns not just to move, but to plan and manage its momentum to solve a
                challenging problem</p>
